# Problem 1: CEO Salary

Install the package `wooldridge`

  - data: `wooldridge::ceosal1`

The data set `ceosal1` contains information on CEOs.

  - `salary`: salary in thousands of dollars.
  
  - `roe`: average return on equity (roe) for the CEO’s firm for the previous three
years.

## Q1

1. Sample size? Find average, minimum and maximum salary.

```{r e1q1}
# find n; avg, min, max salary
ceosal1 %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            avg_sal = mean(salary),
            min_sal = min(salary),
            max_sal = max(salary))
```

---

Estimate the model $$ salary = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}roe + u.$$


```{r}
model_ceo <- lm(salary ~ roe, data = ceosal1)
model_ceo$coefficients
```


$$ \widehat{salary} = 963.191 + 18.501roe$$

## Q2

2. If `roe` is 0, what is the predicted salary?


$$ \widehat{salary} = 963.191 + 18.501roe$$
*If the return on equity is zero, $roe = 0$, then the predicted salary is the intercept, $963.191$, which equals $963,191 because salary is measured in thousands.*


## Q3

$$ \widehat{salary} = 963.191 + 18.501roe$$

3. If `roe` increases by one percentage point, then the salary is predicted to
  change by ?

*If the return on equity increases by one percentage point, $roe = 1$, then salary is predicted to change by about 18.5, or $18,500.*


## Q4

4. If `roe` is 30, what is the predicted salary?

$$ \widehat{salary} = 963.191 + 18.501(30) = 1518.221,$$
which is just over $1.5 million.

## Q5

5. *The firm’s return on equity explains only about 1.3% of the variation in salaries for this sample of 209 CEOs. That means that 98.7% of the salary variations for these CEOs is left unexplained!* --- True or False?

```{r}
summary(model_ceo)$r.squared
```
True!

## Q6

6. *The first four CEOs have lower salaries than what we predicted from the OLS regression line. --- True or False?*

```{r}
broom::augment(model_ceo) %>% head(n = 4)
```

True!

## Q7

7. *The fifth CEO makes more than predicted from the OLS regression line.* --- True or False?

```{r}
broom::augment(model_ceo) %>% slice(5)
```
True!

## Q8

8. Rather than measuring `salary` in thousands of dollars, we want to measure it in dollars. Mutate a new variable `salardol` using this expression  `salardol = 1000*salary`. Now estimate the following model:

$$salarydol = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}roe + u.$$

```{r}
# mutate
ceosal1_new <- ceosal1 %>%
  mutate(salarydol = salary*1000)
# model
model_ceo2 <- lm(salarydol ~ roe, data = ceosal1_new)

```

---

```{r}
model_ceo$coefficients # salary in thousands of dollars
model_ceo2$coefficients # salary in dollars
```

---

*If the dependent variable is multiplied by the constant $c$ -- which means each value in the sample is multiplied by $c$ -- then the OLS
intercept and slope estimates are also multiplied by $c$.* --- True!



# Problem 2: College GPA

`wooldridge::gpa1`

  - `colGPA`: college grade point average
  
  - `hsGPA`: high school GPA 
  
     - both college and high school GPAs are on a four-point scale.
  
  - `ACT`: standardized test score
  
  - `PC`: dummy variable
     
     - 1 if a student owns a personal computer
     
     - 0 otherwise

## Q1

1. How many students own PC?

```{r}
gpa1 %>% 
  count(PC)
```

## Q2

Estimate the following model:

$$colGPA = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\ hsGPA +  \beta_{2}\ ACT + u.$$

```{r}
model_gpa <- lm(colGPA ~ hsGPA + ACT, data = gpa1)
model_gpa$coefficients
```

---

$$\widehat{colGPA} = 1.29 + 0.453\ hsGPA +\ 0.0094ACT $$


2. *There is a positive partial relationship between `colGPA` and `hsGPA`: holding ACT fixed, another point on `hsGPA` is associated with .453 of a point on the college GPA * --- True or False?

True!

## Q3

$$\widehat{colGPA} = 1.29 + 0.453\ hsGPA +\ 0.0094ACT $$

3. *Given the fact that the highest possible score on the ACT is 36, the coefficient on ACT practically small.* --- True or False?

True!

## Q4

4. To determine the effects of computer ownership on college grade point average, estimate the following model:

$$colGPA = \beta_{0} + \delta_{0} \ PC + \beta_{1}\ hsGPA +  \beta_{2}\ ACT + u.$$
```{r}
model_gpa2 <- lm(colGPA ~ PC + hsGPA + ACT, data = gpa1)
model_gpa2$coefficients
```
---

$$\widehat{colGPA} = 1.26 + 0.157 \ PC + 0.447\ hsGPA +  0.0087\ ACT + u.$$

*This equation implies that a student who owns a PC has a predicted GPA about 1.6 points higher than a comparable student without a PC.* --- True or False?

False!

## Q5

5. Generate a factor variable `PC2`: "Yes" if `PC = 0` otherwise "No". Similarly, generate `PC3` with `levels = c("Yes", "No")`.


```{r}
gpa1 <- gpa1 %>%
  mutate(PC2 = factor(if_else(PC == 1, "Yes", "No"),
                      levels = c("Yes", "No")),
         PC3 = factor(if_else(PC == 1, "Yes", "No")))
  
```

---

Estimate the following models:

$$colGPA = \beta_{0} + \delta_{0} \ PC2+ \beta_{1}\ hsGPA +  \beta_{2}\ ACT + u.$$
$$colGPA = \beta_{0} + \delta_{0} \ PC3+ \beta_{1}\ hsGPA +  \beta_{2}\ ACT + u.$$



---

```{r}
model_gpa3 <- lm(colGPA ~ PC2 + hsGPA + ACT, data = gpa1)
model_gpa3$coefficients
```
```{r}
model_gpa4 <- lm(colGPA ~ PC3 + hsGPA + ACT, data = gpa1)
model_gpa4$coefficients
```
