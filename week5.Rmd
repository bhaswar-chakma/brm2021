### dplyr

#### Grammar of Data Manipulation 

```{r logo-dplyr, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```


<span style="color: blue;">**Five Verbs:**</span>
    
  1. `select()` picks variables based on their names.
  2. `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
  3. `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
  4. `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
  5. `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.



#### **Example**

Data: [Click here to download](https://ucppt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/bhaswar_chakma_ucp_pt/EtziHFqAtc5BsmTvQ1nc9XIBP8d6H9_ns-vNPvMzCwjQ3g?e=C5Dwv4) or check in Teams/Files.

**Prepare Data**

<span style="color: blue;">*Step 1: Create/Open RStudio Project*</span> 

<span style="color: blue;">*Step 2: Read the Excel file `w5-simple.xlsx`; store it as `df_simple`*</span> 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
df_simple <- read_excel("data/w5/w5-simple.xlsx")
df_simple
```

<span style="color: blue;">*Step 3: Rename*</span>

Use `rename()` and the pipe operator `%>%`

Keyboard shortcut for `%>%`:

  - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+M `
  - Mac: `Cmd+Shift+M `

```{r rename, echo = TRUE}
df_simple <- df_simple %>% 
  rename(name = Name,
         age = Age,
         gender = Gender,
         course = Course,
         grade = Grade,
         us_born = "Born In the U.S.A.")
df_simple
```

#### {.tabset}

##### *`select()`*


**Problem:** <span style="color: blue;">*Suppose we want to drop the variable `course`*</span>


**Solution:**

- <span style="color: blue;">*We could select the other variables*</span>

```
# by supplying the variable names
df_simple %>%
  select(name, age, gender, grade, us_born)
```
or

```
# by supplying positions
df_simple %>%
  select(1, 2, 3, 5, 6)
```
or

```
# by supplying positions(another way)
df_simple %>%
  select(1:3, 5:6)
```

- <span style="color: blue;">*We could directly drop it*</span>


```
df_simple %>% 
  select(!course) # ! stands for "not"
```

or 


```
df_simple %>% 
  select(- course) 
```

There are many more options!

##### *`mutate()`*

**Problem:** <span style="color: blue;">*Suppose we want to find percentage grades(currently grades are given out of 20). How to create such variable? For example, $\frac{18}{20}$ becomes $90$.*</span>


**Solution:**

Let's call the new variable `grade_p`

```{r example-mutate}
df_simple %>% 
  mutate(grade_p = grade/20*100)
```


##### *`filter()`*

Let's have a `glimpse()` of our data frame `df_simple`!

```{r}
glimpse(df_simple) # you can also use str(df_simple)
```




**Problem 1:** <span style="color: blue;">*Suppose we want to find out who are older than 45.*</span>



**Solution 1:**
```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  filter(age > 45)
```

**Problem 2:** <span style="color: blue;">*Suppose we want to consider females only.*</span>


**Solution 2:**


```{r ex2-fil}
df_simple %>% 
  filter(gender == "Female") # or filter(gender != "Male")
```

**Problem 3:** <span style="color: blue;">*Suppose we want to find out who was(were) not born in the US.*</span>


**Solution 3:**

```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  filter(us_born == FALSE) # filter(us_born != TRUE)
```


<span style="color: blue;">**Logical Operators:**</span>

| Code   | Description              |
|--------|--------------------------|
| <      | less than                |
| <=     | less than or equal to    |
| >      | greater than             |
| >=     | greater than or equal to |
| ==     | exactly equal to         |
| !=     | not equal to             |
| !x     | not x                    |
| x \| y | x or y                   |
| x & y  | x and y                  |

##### *`summarise()`*

**Problem 1:** Suppose we want to find mean and median grades.

**Solution:**

```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  summarise(mean_grade = mean(grade),
            median_grade = median(grade))
```
<span style="color: blue;">NOTE: `summarise` creates a new data frame (of course, to store it, you need to ask your best friend -- the assignment operator!)</span>


**Problem 2:** Suppose we want to find mean and median grades by **`gender`**.

**Solution:**

To do so, we need to use `group_by()` before `summarise()`.

```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_grade = mean(grade),
            median_grade = median(grade))
```


<span style="color: blue;">**Useful Functions:**</span>

| Function | What it Calculates  |
|----------|---------------------|
| mean()   | Mean                |
| median() | Median              |
| var()    | Variance            |
| sd()     | Standard deviation  |
| min()    | Minimum             |
| max()    | Maximum       |


##### *`arrange()`*

`arrange()` orders the rows of a data frame by the values of selected column(s).
  
  - <span style="color: blue;">**use `desc()` or `-` for descending order**</span> 

> **Example (single column): sort name**

```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  arrange(name)
```

```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  arrange(desc(name))
```

> **Example (multiple columns): sort gender then sort name**

```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  arrange(gender, name) # try using desc()
```


<span style="color: blue;">**Unlike other `dplyr` verbs, `arrange()` largely ignores grouping; you need to explicitly mention grouping variables (or use `.by_group = TRUE`)** </span>


- Suppose our data frame `df_simple` is grouped by `gender`
    - `df_simple <- df_simple %>% group_by(gender)`

```{r}
df_simple <- df_simple %>% 
  group_by(gender)
glimpse(df_simple)

```

- `df_simple %>% arrange(name)` will <span style="color: red;">**not**</span> 
 take grouping into account


```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  arrange(name)
```

- you need to use `df_simple_grouped %>% arrange(name,` <span style="color: blue;">**`.by_group = TRUE`**</span> )


```{r}
df_simple %>% 
  arrange(name, .by_group = TRUE)
```

<span style="color: blue;">**To ungroup, use `ungroup()`** </span>

- `df_simple %>% ungroup()` will do the job
